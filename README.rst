Overview
--------

Django Cache Headers allows you to set HTTP caching headers for URL patterns
according to certain policies. It does not perform any caching itself - it
merely sets the headers on the response which are then interpreted by eg. Nginx.

Installation
------------

1. Install or add ``django-cache-headers`` to your Python path.
2. Add ``cache_headers`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting.
3. Add ``cache_headers.middleware.CacheHeadersMiddleware`` before
   SessionMiddleware and AuthenticationMiddleware to your ``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`` setting.

Policies
--------
Django Cache Headers provides four caching policies. You may define your own policies.:

1. all-users - response is marked as cached once for all users.
2. anonymous-only - response is marked as cached once only for anonymous users.
3. anonymous-and-authenticated - response is marked as cached once for anonymous users and once for authenticated users.
4. per-user - response is marked as cached once for anonymous users and for each authenticated user individually.

Settings
--------

The ``timeouts`` key combines the policy, timeout in seconds and URL regexes in a nested dictionary::

    CACHE_HEADERS = {
        "timeouts": {
            "all-users": {
                60: (
                    "^/all-users/",
                )
            },
            "anonymous-only": {
                60: (
                    "^/anonymous-only/",
                )
            },
            "anonymous-and-authenticated": {
                60: (
                    "^/anonymous-and-authenticated/",
                )
            },
            "per-user": {
                60: (
                    "^/per-user/",
                )
            },
            "custom-policy": {
                60: (
                    "^/custom-policy/",
                )
            }
        }
    }
